[A] Answer the following:
(a) Mention 5 fields in which Python  is popularly used.
# 1- System Programming 
# 2- Building GUI Application
# 3- Console Application 
# 4- Robotics Programming 
# 5- Numeric and Scientific Programming
(b) Where is event - driven programming popularly used ? 
# This programming pardigms popularly used in GUI applications containing windows, checkboxes, scrollbars, buttons etc
(c) Why Python is called Portable language?
# Because python create byte code from source code and it can be used by different PMVs as per the OS and execute it that's why Python is portable language.
(d) What is the single most important feature of different programming models disscussed in this chapter?
# Object - Oriented Programming Model is the single most important feature of different programming models discussed in this chapter.
(e) Which of the following is not a feature of Python?  
- Static typing 
- Dynamic Typing  
- Run-time error handling through error numbers 
- Library support for containers like  Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples.
# Answer: Run-time error handling through error numbers is not a feature of Python
(f) Give an example application of each of the following programming models:
# Example applications for different programming models:
 Functional Programming # Example: Data processing pipelines, mathematical computations
 Procedural Programming # Example: Command line utilities, batch processing scripts
 Object-Oriented Programming # Example: Game development, enterprise applications
 Event-Driven Programming # Example: GUI applications, web applications, mobile apps

[B] State whether the following statements are True or False:
(a) Python is free to  use and distribute. {True}
(b) Same Python program can work on different OS - microporcessor combinations. {True} 
(c) It is possible to use C++ or Java libraries in a Python Program {True}
(d) In Python type of the variable is decided based on its usage. {True}
(e) Python can not be used for building GUI applications. {False}
(f) Python supports functional, procedural, object-oriented and event-driven programming models.{True}
(g) GUI applications are based on event-driven programming model. {True}
(h) Functional programming model consists of interaction of multiple objects. {False}  

[C] Match the following pairs:
(a) Functional programming ---- 4 - Math-like functions
(b) Event-driven programming ---- 1 - GUI element-based interaction
(c) Procedural programming ---- 3 - Statments
(d) OOP ---- 2 - Interaction of Objects

[D] Fill in the blanks:
(a) Funtional programming paradigm is also known as '''Declarative programming''' model.
(b) Procedural programming paradigm is also known as '''Imperative programming''' model.
(c) Python was created by '''Guido Van Rossum'''
(d) Python programmers often called Pythonists or Pythonistas.
